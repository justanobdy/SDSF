# Using this template

To use this template, copy `Makefile` and `Game/` to a folder of your choosing, along with the `include` and `source` directory, and start building!

If you would like to edit the info text in the .nds file, just edit the `GAME_TITLE`, `GAME_SUBTITLE1`, and `GAME_SUBTITLE2` entries at the top of the `Makefile`.
